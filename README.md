# 📋 Clipboard Saver Extension

My **first time** trying to make a web extension/add-on… and well, it didn’t go exactly as planned 😅.  
But hey, at least there’s a start!  

This addon is a **clipboard manager** that lets you save and paste **5 pieces of text** you copied, so you don’t have to go back and forth all the time. Super handy if you’re copying multiple things at once.  

Making the extension itself wasn’t that big of a task, but the **setup… oh boy**. I love Mozilla Firefox, but setting up an extension there (that isn’t temporary) is kinda a pain in the ass 😬. Firefox doesn’t allow unsigned extensions—you have to submit it to their developer forum and get it verified and signed.  

Not blaming Mozilla entirely though. The whole `manifest.json` thing is still kind of in development on the Morzilla side (perks of Google’s Chromium engine, am I right?).

There might better ways to do in morzilla which i haven't checked BUT

Anyways, my extension **currently works quiet good on Edge & Chrome**.
